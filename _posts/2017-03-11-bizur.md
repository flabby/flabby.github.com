## 0 Abstract

* strong consistency
* Do not use Distributed Log(Paxos Zab Raft)
* main difference with Paxos-like consensus
    - aimed at key-value data model, instead of general model

## 1 Introduction

### 1.2 drawbacks of distributed log

* dependency:
    - real dependencies:  entries of same content x
    - false dependencies:  succeeding entries
* failure detect, recovery take a long time
* need log compaction(snapshot or checkpoint)

## 2 Algorithm

* hash bucket:  1 bucket --> have many key-value
    - bucket内顺序执行；
    - bucket之间并发
    - 每个bucket有主从（实际所有bucket一个leader)
    - Replication bucket维度的

### 2.1 Leader election

```powershell
procedure STARTELECTION
    elect_id←electi_d+1
    send PLEASEVOTE(elect id, self ) to all
    if received ACKVOTE from majority then
        is_leader ← true
procedure PLEASEVOTE(elect id, source)
    if elect id > voted_elect_id then
        voted_elect_id ← elect_id 
        leader ← source
        reply ACKVOTE to source
    else if elect id = voted_elect_id and
            source = leader then
        reply ACKVOTE to source
    else reply NACKVOTE to source
```

>Claim 1: 每个elect_id 最多只有一个 is_leader == true

## 2.2 replication

* bucket
    - index
    - version:
        * elect_id
        * counter

* write操作 
* read操作： 需要ENSURERECOVERY
    - leader change之后第一个read会recovery
* recovery： 会read, 从大多数中选出最高version的bucket, 然后write


```powershell
# write
procedure WRITE(bucket) ⊲ By leader 
    bucket.ver.elect_id ← elect_id
    bucket.ver.counter ← bucket.ver.counter + 1
    send REPLICAWRITE(bucket, self ) to all
    if received ACKWRITE from majority then
        return true
    else
        is_leader ← false
        return false
        
procedure REPLICAWRITE(bucket, source)
    if bucket.ver.elect_id < voted_elect_id then
        reply NACKWRITE to source
    else
        voted_elect_id ← bucket.ver.elect_id
        leader ← source             ⊲    “update” vote             
        local_buckets[bucket.index] ← bucket
        reply ACKWRITE to source
```

```powershell
# Read
procedure READ(index)           ⊲ By leader 
    if not ENSURERECOVERY(index, elect_id) then
        return ⊥
    send REPLICAREAD(index, elect id, self ) to all 
    if received ACKREAD from majority then
        return local_buckets[index] 
    else
        is_leader ← false
        return ⊥

procedure REPLICAREAD(index, elect_id, source)
    if elect_id < voted_elec_id then 
    reply NACKREAD to source
    else
        voted_elect_id ← elect_id
        leader ← source
        reply ACKREAD(local_buckets[index]) to source
```

```powershell
# Recovery
procedure ENSURERECOVERY(index, elect_id)
    if elect_id = local_buckets[index].ver.elect_id then
        return true
    send REPLICAREAD(index, elect_id, self ) to all
    if received ACKREAD from majority then
        max_ver ← max{bucket.ver | received bucket}
        bucket ← some bucket s.t. bucket.ver = max_ver
        bucket.ver.elect_id ← elect_id
        bucket.ver.counter ← 0
        return WRITE(bucket)
    else
        is leader ← false
        return false
```

### Other

* key-value wrapper based on read write operation
* reconfiguration: 
    - two instances runing old and new
    - with special reconfigure state
        * old not serve, while new read will copy bucket if necessary
* some optimization
* scalability
